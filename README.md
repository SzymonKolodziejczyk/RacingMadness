Hello!
This is my attempt at creating a 2D Arcade Racing Game. Hopefully, I'll succeed!

Things that are done:
-Car Controller
-Car models
-Checkpoint and lap system
-Health and respawn system
-Basic particles and sfx
-Basic menu system
-Basic scene transition
-Ghost car
-Basic UI
-Leaderboard
-Basic AI
-Jump over obstacles
-Terrain obstacles
-Main game mode: Race against AI

Plan to do before release:
-Better UI (in progress)
-Make some game footage to showcase in the main menu (in progress)
-Better VFX (in progress)
-Finish my own assets (in progress)
-Plan and make it so I have at least 8 maps (in progress)
-Championship mode (worry in the future)
-Demolition mode (worry in the future)
-Overall polish, so it's perfect (mega worry in the future)

Post-release plan:
-Co-op mode
-Endless mode
-Play with up to 4 friends
-Other modes
-More things as I work on this project!
